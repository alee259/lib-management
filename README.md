# Library Management System
This system was developed as a project to allow for people to manage a large amount of books and people who are registered to rent the books. The program uses two main text files, one for the books and one for the users, to set up a base of information. The system allows users to search for books, check their own library accounts, display library information, and return and rent out new books. Users have a limit to how many books they can rent out at once.
